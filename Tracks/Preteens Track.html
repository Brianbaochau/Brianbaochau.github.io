                Hello everyone, this is going to be the description section for Preteens Track, where you can let the kids know what to expect
                prior to the start of the actual retreat. In addition to giving an overview of the track program, you can also use this
                space as an opportunity to let the kids know what they should do or what to items to bring in order to prepare for the 
                activities ahead of time. If you have any questions or if you need custom settings on this page, such as buttons
                linking to reflection questions/booklets, just let me know and I can work with you on that. Thank you!
            </p>
